  description: >
    Lookup table defining sensor status codes. Each code represents 
    a state a sensor channel or device can be in. IsOperational 
    indicates whether data collected in this state should be considered 
    trustworthy. Severity indicates the urgency (0=normal, 1=warning, 
    2=fault, 3=critical).
